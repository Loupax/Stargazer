# Stargazer
Stargazer is a media player, based on the Meteor javascript platform. 

Right not it just plays a few media files, and the server listens for changes in the filesystem for any new files that might appear (or dissapear)

If you plan on forking-downloading this project, make sure to check the top of the `media-player.js` file at the project root, to set your own media folders. Yes, it is hardcoded for now. Shoot me
